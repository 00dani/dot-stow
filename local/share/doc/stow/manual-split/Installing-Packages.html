<p>The default action of Stow is to install a package.  This means creating
symlinks in the target tree that point into the package tree.  Stow
attempts to do this with as few symlinks as possible; in other words, if
Stow can create a single symlink that points to an entire subtree within
the package tree, it will choose to do that rather than create a
directory in the target tree and populate it with symlinks.

<p>For example, suppose that no packages have yet been installed in
<samp class="file">/usr/local</samp>; it&rsquo;s completely empty (except for the <samp class="file">stow</samp>
subdirectory, of course).  Now suppose the Perl package is installed.
Recall that it includes the following directories in its installation
image:  <samp class="file">bin</samp>; <samp class="file">info</samp>; <samp class="file">lib/perl</samp>; <samp class="file">man/man1</samp>.
Rather than creating the directory <samp class="file">/usr/local/bin</samp> and populating
it with symlinks to <samp class="file">../stow/perl/bin/perl</samp> and
<samp class="file">../stow/perl/bin/a2p</samp> (and so on), Stow will create a
single symlink, <samp class="file">/usr/local/bin</samp>, which points to
<samp class="file">stow/perl/bin</samp>.  In this way, it still works to refer to
<samp class="file">/usr/local/bin/perl</samp> and <samp class="file">/usr/local/bin/a2p</samp>, and fewer
symlinks have been created.  This is called <em class="dfn">tree folding</em>, since an
entire subtree is &ldquo;folded&rdquo; into a single symlink.
</p>
<p>To complete this example, Stow will also create the symlink
<samp class="file">/usr/local/info</samp> pointing to <samp class="file">stow/perl/info</samp>; the symlink
<samp class="file">/usr/local/lib</samp> pointing to <samp class="file">stow/perl/lib</samp>; and the symlink
<samp class="file">/usr/local/man</samp> pointing to <samp class="file">stow/perl/man</samp>.
</p>
<p>Now suppose that instead of installing the Perl package into an empty
target tree, the target tree is not empty to begin with.  Instead, it
contains several files and directories installed under a different
system-administration philosophy.  In particular, <samp class="file">/usr/local/bin</samp>
already exists and is a directory, as are <samp class="file">/usr/local/lib</samp> and
<samp class="file">/usr/local/man/man1</samp>.  In this case, Stow will descend into
<samp class="file">/usr/local/bin</samp> and create symlinks to
<samp class="file">../stow/perl/bin/perl</samp> and <samp class="file">../stow/perl/bin/a2p</samp> (etc.),
and it will descend into <samp class="file">/usr/local/lib</samp> and create the
tree-folding symlink <samp class="file">perl</samp> pointing to
<samp class="file">../stow/perl/lib/perl</samp>, and so on.  As a rule, Stow only
descends as far as necessary into the target tree when it can create a
tree-folding symlink.  However, this behaviour can be changed via
the <samp class="option">--no-folding</samp> option; see <a class="pxref" href="Invoking-Stow.html">Invoking Stow</a>.

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-tree-unfolding"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-tree-unsplitting"></a>
<p>The time often comes when a tree-folding symlink has to be undone
because another package uses one or more of the folded subdirectories in
its installation image.  This operation is called <em class="dfn">splitting open</em> or
<em class="dfn">unfolding</em> a folded tree.  It involves removing the original symlink from
the target tree, creating a true directory in its place, and then populating the
new directory with symlinks to the newly-installed package <em class="emph">and</em> to
the old package that used the old symlink.  For example, suppose that
after installing Perl into an empty <samp class="file">/usr/local</samp>, we wish to
install Emacs.  Emacs&rsquo;s installation image includes a <samp class="file">bin</samp>
directory containing the <samp class="file">emacs</samp> and <samp class="file">etags</samp> executables,
among others.  Stow must make these files appear to be installed
in <samp class="file">/usr/local/bin</samp>, but presently <samp class="file">/usr/local/bin</samp> is a
symlink to <samp class="file">stow/perl/bin</samp>.  Stow therefore takes the
following steps:  the symlink <samp class="file">/usr/local/bin</samp> is deleted; the
directory <samp class="file">/usr/local/bin</samp> is created; links are made from
<samp class="file">/usr/local/bin</samp> to <samp class="file">../stow/emacs/bin/emacs</samp> and
<samp class="file">../stow/emacs/bin/etags</samp>; and links are made from
<samp class="file">/usr/local/bin</samp> to <samp class="file">../stow/perl/bin/perl</samp> and
<samp class="file">../stow/perl/bin/a2p</samp>.

<h3 class="section"><span>5.3 Ownership<a class="copiable-link" href="#Ownership"> &para;</a></span></h3>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-ownership"></a>
<p>When splitting open a folded tree, Stow makes sure that the
symlink it is about to remove points inside a valid package in the
current stow directory.  <em class="emph">Stow will never delete anything
that it doesn&rsquo;t own</em>.  Stow &ldquo;owns&rdquo; everything living in the
target tree that points into a package in the stow directory.  Anything
Stow owns, it can recompute if lost: symlinks that point into a package in
the stow directory, or directories that only contain symlinks that stow
&ldquo;owns&rdquo;.   Note that by this definition, Stow doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;own&rdquo; anything
<em class="emph">in</em> the stow directory or in any of the packages.

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-conflicts"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-installation-conflicts"></a>
<p>If Stow needs to create a directory or a symlink in the target
tree and it cannot because that name is already in use and is not owned
by Stow, then a <em class="dfn">conflict</em> has arisen.  See <a class="xref" href="Conflicts.html">Conflicts</a>.
