<p>In many situations, there will exist files under the package
directories which it would be undesirable to stow into the target
directory.  For example, files related version control such as
<samp class="file">.gitignore</samp>, <samp class="file">CVS</samp>, <samp class="file">*,v</samp> (RCS files) should typically
not have symlinks from the target tree pointing to them.  Also there
may be files or directories relating to the build of the package which
are not needed at run-time.
</p>
<p>In these cases, it can be rather cumbersome to specify a
<samp class="option">--ignore</samp> parameter for each file or directory to be ignored.
This could be worked around by ensuring the existence of
<samp class="file">~/.stowrc</samp> containing multiple <samp class="option">--ignore</samp> lines, or if a
different set of files/directories should be ignored depending on
which stow package is involved, a <samp class="file">.stowrc</samp> file for each stow
package, but this would require the user to ensure that they were in
the correct directory before invoking stow, which would be tedious and
error-prone.  Furthermore, since Stow shifts parameters from
<samp class="file">.stowrc</samp> onto ARGV at run-time, it could clutter up the process
table with excessively long parameter lists, or even worse, exceed the
operating system&rsquo;s limit for process arguments.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-ignore-lists-1"></a>
<p>Therefore in addition to <samp class="option">--ignore</samp> parameters, Stow provides a
way to specify lists of files and directories to ignore.
