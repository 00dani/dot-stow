<p>Cygnus is a commercial supplier and supporter of GNU software.  It has
also written several of its own packages, released under the terms of
the GNU General Public License; and it has taken over the maintenance of
other packages.  Among the packages released by Cygnus are &lsquo;<samp class="samp">gdb</samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">gnats</samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp class="samp">dejagnu</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>Cygnus packages have the peculiarity that each one unpacks into a
directory tree with a generic top-level Makefile, which is set up to
compile <em class="emph">all</em> of Cygnus&rsquo; packages, any number of which may reside
under the top-level directory.  In other words, even if you&rsquo;re only
building &lsquo;<samp class="samp">gnats</samp>&rsquo;, the top-level Makefile will look for, and try to
build, <samp class="file">gdb</samp> and <samp class="file">dejagnu</samp> subdirectories, among many others.
</p>
<p>The result is that if you try &lsquo;<samp class="samp">make -n install
prefix=/usr/local/stow/<var class="var">package</var></samp>&rsquo; at the top level of a Cygnus
package, you&rsquo;ll get a bewildering amount of output.  It will then be
very difficult to visually scan the output to see whether the install
will proceed correctly.  Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s not always clear how to
invoke an install from the subdirectory of interest.
</p>
<p>In cases like this, the best approach is to run your &lsquo;<samp class="samp">make install
prefix=<span class="r">&hellip;</span></samp>&rsquo;, but be ready to interrupt it if you detect that it
is recompiling files.  Usually it will work just fine; otherwise,
install manually.
