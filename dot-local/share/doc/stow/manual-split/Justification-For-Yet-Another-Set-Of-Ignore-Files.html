<p>The reader may note that this format is very similar to existing
ignore list file formats, such as those for <code class="command">cvs</code>, <code class="command">git</code>,
<code class="command">rsync</code> etc., and wonder if another set of ignore lists is
justified.  However there are good reasons why Stow does not simply
check for the presence of say, <samp class="file">.cvsignore</samp>, and use that if it
exists.  Firstly, there is no guarantee that a stow package would
contain any version control meta-data, or permit introducing this if
it didn&rsquo;t already exist.
</p>
<p>Secondly even if it did, version control system ignore lists generally
reflect <em class="emph">build-time</em> ignores rather than <em class="emph">install-time</em>, and
there may be some intermediate or temporary files on those ignore
lists generated during development or at build-time which it would be
inappropriate to stow, even though many files generated at build-time
(binaries, libraries, documentation etc.) certainly do need to be
stowed.  Similarly, if a file is <em class="emph">not</em> in the version control
system&rsquo;s ignore list, there is no way of knowing whether the file is
intended for end use, let alone whether the version control system is
tracking it or not.
</p>
<p>Therefore it seems clear that ignore lists provided by version control
systems do not provide sufficient information for Stow to determine
which files and directories to stow, and so it makes sense for Stow to
support independent ignore lists.
